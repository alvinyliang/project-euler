This is a script to download Project Euler problems into .py files.

I used `Python v2.7.10` and a package called `beautifulsoup4`. Install it by running `pip install beautifulsoup4` on the command line.

What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
